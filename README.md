**Turn static SaaS products into adaptive, intelligent experiences.**  
A Context-as-a-Service platform that turns SaaS products into adaptive experiences. We track user behavior and interaction patterns, then automatically change UI and feature surfaces in real-time.

The result? Higher activation, faster time-to-value, and lower churn, without rewriting your product.

Think personalised onboarding, guided workflows, and adaptive UX shipped in minutes, not months.

## 🚀 What It Does

Most users drop off not because a product is bad but because the experience doesn’t adapt to them.

This platform connects to your SaaS product and provides real-time **context signals** that let you:

✅ Personalise onboarding flows. 
✅ Adapt feature surfaces automatically.
✅ Guide users intelligently based on behavior.
✅ Reduce friction and increase activation.
✅ Prevent silent churn.
✅ Build smarter UX with zero-engineering overhead.

## 💡 Why It Matters

| Problem Today | Our Perspective |
|---------------|------------------|
| One-size-fits-all onboarding hurts activation | Every user has unique intent |
| Hard-coded UX slows teams down | UX should evolve in real time |
| Churn is treated as a reporting metric | It should be prevented |
| AI alone lacks context | Context is the foundation for personalisation |

Software should **respond**—not react.
